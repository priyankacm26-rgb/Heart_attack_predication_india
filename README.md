# Heart_attack_predication_india
This project analyzes hospital patient data using SQL to identify key patterns and risk factors associated with heart attacks. It includes data cleaning, SQL queries, aggregations, correlations, KPIs, and insights derived directly from structured query analysis. Dataset: Hospital_Data.csv → imported into a SQL database.
# ❤️ Heart Attack Analysis Using SQL

## 📌 Project Overview
This SQL-based project focuses on analyzing hospital patient data to understand **patterns, risk factors, and trends** related to heart attacks.  
Instead of machine learning, all insights are derived purely through **SQL queries, aggregations, and reporting**.

The goal is to:
- Clean the raw dataset  
- Explore health indicators  
- Identify correlations  
- Create KPIs  
- Generate meaningful insights using SQL
